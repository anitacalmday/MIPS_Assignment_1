Problem: 
You will write a MIPS program that reads a string of up to 8 characters from user input. 
If the string has only the characters from '0' to '9' and from 'a' to 'f' and from 'A' to 'F', the program prints out the unsigned decimal integer corresponding to the hexadecimal number in the string.
Otherwise, the program prints out the message of "Invalid hexadecimal number.".  

Solution: 
1. Prompt user for input
2. Check user input 
    2a.If user input is not characters from '0' to '9' and 'a' to 'f' and 'A' to 'F', then return 'Invalid hexadecimal number'.
    2b. Else, convert hexadecimal to the unsigned decimal integer
    2c. Return decimal integer
